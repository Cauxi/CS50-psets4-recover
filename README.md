<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Recover" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/recover/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem set, I implemented a program that recovers JPEG images from a forensic memory card dump. The program scans a raw memory file and extracts JPEGs by identifying their distinct header patterns. Once a JPEG is detected, it writes the recovered image to a new file.</p> <p>This solution was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>. Uploading my solution to GitHub complies with CS50’s academic honesty policy. For additional clarification, you can refer to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/63235w/is_this_reasonable/">Reddit thread</a>.</p>
Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Input</strong>: The program takes a forensic memory dump in the form of a `.raw` file as input.</li> <li><strong>JPEG Detection</strong>: It identifies JPEGs based on their specific signature bytes (0xff 0xd8 0xff and the subsequent byte).</li> <li><strong>File Writing</strong>: Each detected JPEG is written to a separate file named sequentially (e.g., `000.jpg`, `001.jpg`, etc.).</li> <li><strong>Memory Handling</strong>: It uses a buffer to read 512-byte blocks from the input file and performs memory management to ensure efficient reading and writing.</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Open Input File</strong>: The program opens the raw forensic dump file and begins reading it in 512-byte chunks.</li> <li><strong>JPEG Signature Detection</strong>: The program identifies the start of a new JPEG by checking the first four bytes of each 512-byte block.</li> <li><strong>File Creation</strong>: When a new JPEG is detected, the program opens a new file and writes subsequent blocks until another JPEG is found or the file ends.</li> <li><strong>Close Files</strong>: Once all JPEGs are recovered, the program ensures all files are closed properly to avoid memory leaks or data loss.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as the memory dump (`card.raw`) or the Makefile.</p>
